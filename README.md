# SimRs

This is an experimental discrete event simulation library I use in my research project.
I'm not sure at the moment how much value it has for others but I found the things I did
here interesting, so maybe someone else will as well.

Visit https://docs.rs/simrs/0.1.2/simrs/ for more information and documentation.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or criticism, don't hesitate to reach out
by either contacting me directly or opening an issue.
